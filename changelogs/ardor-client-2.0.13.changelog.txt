Bundlers page UI improvements and bugfixes.

Added AccountPropertyBundler add-on, which only bundles transactions sent by
accounts having the "bundling" property set on them by the bundler. To enable,
set nxt.bundlingFilter=nxt.addons.AccountPropertyBundler. This will apply to
all bundlers started on this node.

Added minimumFeeFQT field to the response for all Create Transaction APIs,
indicating the minimum required fee in ARDR, regardless of the actual fee
specified by the sender.

Desktop wallet performance optimizations to reduce excessive load.

Local signing and validation bugfixes, other minor code improvements.
